# WebFull
play video in full webpage
This is a extension for Chrome(Will make it support other Browser in the future). It will open an individual window for the video and can make the video be FullWeb Play.
This is a feature I want when watching video and playing game at the same time. Unfortunately, most video site do not have this feature. 
This extension does not remove ad.
